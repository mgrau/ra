# TODO

## features

- implement a phase where a player may choose which monument and civilization tiles to discard from earthquake and war disasters.
  - perhaps when they bid, so as not to have to deal with turn sequence
- game end screen
- resolve disaster tiles when obtained using a god tile.
- add test that score can't go negative
- prevent underbids.
- resolve tie for points. The player with highest numbered sun disk wins.

## bugs

- turn order at the start of a new epoch incorrect (failing test).
- scoring doesn't work when player score is hidden.
